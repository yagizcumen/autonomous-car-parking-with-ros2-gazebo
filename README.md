# Autonomous Parking Algorithm with ROS2 and Gazebo  

This repository showcases an **autonomous parking algorithm** developed using **ROS2** and **Gazebo**. The project simulates real-world scenarios where a vehicle detects its surroundings and accurately parks in a designated area. It integrates essential components of autonomous systems, such as control, perception, and motion planning.

## üöó Features  

- **Perception**:  
  - Detects parking spaces and lane markings using **YOLOv8** and **Hough Transform**.  
- **Motion Control**:  
  - Implements a **PID control algorithm** to ensure precise parking between the lines.  
- **Simulation Environment**:  
  - Tested in a realistic **Gazebo simulation** to validate autonomous navigation and control.  
- **Modular Design**:  
  - Designed with modular ROS2 nodes for easy integration with different sensors and hardware setups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  

- **ROS2 Humble**: Middleware for communication between nodes.  
- **Gazebo**: 3D simulation environment for testing.  
- **YOLOv8**: Object detection for identifying parking signs.  
- **Python/C++**: Used for algorithm implementation and ROS2 node development.
